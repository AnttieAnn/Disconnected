    "You knock on the door a few times. When there's no answer, you open it yourself."
    "You notice most of the drawers are open and Anne's bags are half packed."

    C "Leaving already?"
    "His voice catches Anne by surprise. She stares at you and Conrad before responding."

    A "I was planning on it, but then I had to think a few things out."

    A "[P], do you remmeber when I told you that I wasn't sure what I wanted to do after high school?"
    A "I told my aunt about it while we were here."
    A "I asked her for advice on what to do since she's o successful."
    A "She suggested that I try out working for her over the summer."
    A "She sad that, if I do good job and I like it, it could be a permanent position."
    A "The pay is decent and she said that I can live with her until I find a place of my own."
    C "Woah, that's great news! That's an amazing opportunity for you, Anne!"
    A "I'm not sure if I want to accept it, though"
    C "Are you kidding? You'd be crazy not to accept it!"
    C "Er, well... I guess I'm not being considerate, am I?"
    C "What's giving you second thoughts?"
    A "This would be a drastic change for my life. I'd have to go through training, move across the country, and..."
    "She looks at you and Conrad"
    P "... And you wouldn't be able to talk to us as often."
    A "Yeah, exactly..."
    C "This is a big decision for you. Don't let us affect your decision."
    A "No, it's alright! I'd like to hear what both of you think."
    C "I guess if it were up to me, I'd accept it in a heartbeat"
    C "I can't really compare my situation to yours, though"
    C "I always knew I wanted to keep playing football after high school, so accepting my scholarship was a big no-brainer to me."
    C "But I'll admit that afterwards I had some second thoughts. Especially after I stop talking to both of you..."
    C "And ESPECIALLY after I found out that I hurt you."
    C "But now that I have both of you supporting me, all of the stress I had from training and moving to a different state is nothing anymore."
    C "I'm glad I accepted my offer, and I feel like you should accept yours."
    C "Those are just my two cents. I dont know about you or [P], though."

        #"You should accept the offer.":

        #"You should think about this longer.":

    A "Yeah, it's a really great opportunity."
    A "But"

    "You arrive at the airport with Conrad as you both prepare to leave."
    C "What are the odds of us leaving on the same day, huh?"
    C "When's your flight back to San Francisco?"
    P "In about a couple hours. I just wanted to be early."
    C "Yeah, that seems like you. My flight leaves in about half an hour."
    SSV "Guess I have half an hour to say my sappy goodbyes, then."#Soft-Spoken voice
    "You and Conrad turn around to see who's speaking to you."
    "It's Anne!"
    C "Anne! What are you doing here?"
    P "Are you flying back to Glendale?"
    A "No, but me not flying is part of the reason why I came"
    A "I decided that I want to stay here. I'm going to accept my aunt's offer and wanted to tell you both before I do."
    A "But that's not the only reason I'm here."

    "Anne starts to smile brightly"

    A "I wanted to say goodbye to both of you in person before you both go."
    A "I can't believe you're going to college, Conrad."
    A "*chuckles* And to think, just a few years ago you were this hopeless boy getting wrecked by zombies on WumpCraft"
    C "Now I'm going to be a hopeless boy getting wrecked by exams in college!"
    C "I have to say, though. It's pretty funy how I'm moving to California at the same time you're moving to Florida."
    C "I guess we're destined to always have the timezone curse."
    A "I didn't realize your college is in California. Brilliant!"
    C "That's about the hundreth time I've heard you say 'brilliant' since you came here."
    C "Keep it up and you'll have to change your Discord username to '@BrilliantAnne.'"
    A "One 'brilliant' reference is enough. The username is a bit too on the nose."
    A "So [P], what are you planning to do once you go back home?"

    menu:
        "Maybe I'll get a job like Anne.":
            P "Maybe I'll get a job like you"
            A "Brilliant! If you ever need some extra cash, I could probably put in a recomendation to my aunt to hire you."
            C "*laughs* The image of [P] running aroud and taking orders from your aunt just seems really funny to me."
            C "But hey, that's a great idea. You know we'll always have your back no matter what you decide."
            C "And don't hesitate to reach out to us!"

        "Maybe I'll go to college like Conrad.":
            P "Maybe I'll go to college like Conrad."
            C "Hey, that's pretty cool! Maybe we'll end up at the same college. I could put a good word in to my coach and have us on the same football team!"
            A "*laughs*"
            A "The image of [P] running around and trying to be an athlete just seems really funny to me."
            A "But hey, that's a great idea. You know we'll always support your decision no matter what."
            C "And don't hesitate to reach out to us!"

        "I'm not really sure what I want to do, yet":
            P "I'm not really sure what I want to do, yet."
            A "That's totally fine. You know we'll always have your back no matter what you decide."
            C "I couldn't have said it better myself!"
            C "If you ever need help with whatever you want to do after all of this, don't hesitate to reach out to us!"

    A "Conrad's right. Just because we're all going in different directions in life doesn't mean we have to cut each other out completely."
    A "I'm probably going to be really busy helping my aunt."
    C "And training's going to be crazy for me for the next four years..."
    C "But I won't ghost on all of you like I did last time. I'll make sure of it."
    C "I'll be sure to update you guys whenever I can."
    A "Brilliant! I'll do it, too."
    P "I'm looking forward to the future. And I'm glad I'll get to share it with you both."

    "An annoucement for Conrad's flight departing soon rings across the airport lobby."

    "You all look at each other a bit saddened that your reunion had to be cut short"

    C "Looks like I'll have to go right now."

    "Conrad stays still for a moment as if he's unsure about what he should do next"
    "Suddenly, Anne leaps onto him for a bear hug!"

    C "Ack! Tackled! Fou play!"
    "Conrad and Anne started to laugh as Anne starts to loosen her grip."
    "You start to laugh as well at the other two's childish antics and then decided to join in for a group hug."
    "Somehow, all the sadness you felt about leaving started to drift away during that hug."

    A "Both of you have a safe trip back home!"
    "Anne was the first one to break the hug."
    A "Hey! Before you go, I have something to give you."
    "Anne reaches into her purse and pulls out an alligator keychain and hands it to Conrad"
    A "I got this at the gift shop when [P] and I first landed here."
